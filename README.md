# Film-4-U

This project has been created with HTML5 and CSS3.

The project consist of 3 pages.

# Index

On the first page we find the a form with different inputs such as "user" and "password".

- We have created a pattern for the "user" input which has to be completed with an E-mail or similiar

  `E.g.: user@example.com`

- The password must contain at least 6 digits.

# Main-page

The main page contains a list of different movies.

- On a computer, with a hover over each image, some information on such movie will appear in front of it.

- On mobile devices, touching the image will show the same information described above.

This page contains 2 important display effects through CSS.

We can observe on the navigation bar the "display: grid", wich maintain the proportions of it.
The main section of the page is composed of different figures, all them displayed with flexbox. This allows the page to maintain order and proportion no matter the size of the display.

# Watch-page

The watch page consists of a model (every movie redirect to the same page) of how the total information on such movie should be shown.
It consists of a video of the movie (a trailer, actually), the complete information about it, and some related movies.
